aether
======

**aether** is a highly experimental, fast and robust API library for Discord.

This project is being built from the learning lessons of interactions.py and retux.
The scope and goals of this project are simple:

- Lightweight, strict API typings for data structures, including events and resources
- Fast runtime and wall time
- Simple and compact

aether is not a fully fledged library â€“ it is meant to be an educational resource for
others aspiring to become library developers. Please do not use aether while in alpha
state as it is likely bound to change at any given moment.

More details can be found on the repository and stream VODs.
